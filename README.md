# **Track It**: a delivery management system

Track It is an online desktop application for the management of deliveries from traditional wine stores and restaurants to people at home. Through it, managers can keep track of the delivery employees (riders), deliveries and connected stores, as well as manipulate certain aspects, such as changing a delivery's automatically assigned rider, accept or dismiss job applications and fire riders who do not perform satisfactory work.
